            <h4>The Process:</h4>
            <p>
                We used a Weighted Decision Matrix to evaluate and compare the candidates. The first step was to identify the
                evaluation criteria we would use - to do this we had to talk to our Client to find out how the project management
                system would be used by Capstone Project staff and students. The evaluation categories we chose were Audit, Project
                Management, Integration, Accessibility, Access Control, and User Feedback. We then had to decide the weighting of each criteria - this
                involved asking questions like "is Project Management capability worth more than Usability?". The third step before
                starting our evaluations was to decide on a scoring system. This meant deciding what each score for each evaluation
                criteria would look like and creating exemplars to use as references. This helped to ensure consistency between
                the scores given by each team member. Finally, we created a list of Exclusion Criteria - if a candidate met one of
                the Exclusion Criteria then they were not suitable and were immediately excluded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we had designed the Weighted Decision Matrix, we researched each of the candidates and gave them a score for
                each of the evaluation categories (Unless they met one of the Exclusion Criteria - in that case they were added to the
                Exclusions List and removed from consideration). For each remaining candidate, we then multiplied the score for each
                evaluation category by the category weighting and then added the results together to give a total score. This let us
                compare the project management systems to each other easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the first round of evaluation, we learned more about what the Client needed and add two new Exclusion Criteria and
                adjusted the evaluation category exemplars. We then repeated the scoring process. We then used a sensitivity analysis
                to check the results and to build confidence that the categories and weightings were appropriate.
                The Client then asked us to consider adding Cost as an evaluation category. We adjusted the Weighted Decision to include Cost,
                and repeated the scoring process. A sensitivity analysis was repeated and confirmed that Cost was a relevant category.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the 3 rounds of evaluation, the 50 candidates had been reduced to 14. After removing any that scored
                less than 3/5 in any category, and considering the pros and cons of each project management system, this was reduced
                to the four final shortlisted options: Avaza, Basecamp, Freedcamp, and ZenHub.
