                                    Kubernetes for WelTec was a project which aimed to deliver a product which could replace Netlab, the School of IT's current lab delivery system, with a Kubernetes-based solution
                                </p>

                                    Netlab is an online learning solution which provides/allows students from the School of IT to access pre-configured virtual lab environments from any internet-capable device. Each lab environment contains one or more virtual computer systems (known as virtual machines) which students can interact with via a web interface in order to complete their assigned lab work.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our client for this project was Paul Bryant, a Senior Lecturer from WelTec's School of IT, who saw the opportunity to replace Netlab with a more cost-efficent solution after being inspired by a similar system deployed by the Edinburgh Napier University.

                                In order to meet our client's need, we decided to develop an ASP.NET Core web application that would allow users to create and interact with lab environments - collections of pre-configured networked Docker containers hosted within a Kubernetes cluster managed by the School of IT.
                            </p>       
                            <p>
                                Although the system which inspired our project was based on Kubernetes,  we examined other potential solutions prior to starting development, including OpenStack and Proxmox Virtual Environment. We considered factors such as cost and complexity when making our selection, along with each option's suitability given our clients' needs. In the end, Kubernetes remained our platform of choice, as it appeared to be simpler to implement than OpenStack, the other entirely free option. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Kubernetes is a free and open-source container orchestration platform - it is used to manage container workloads spread across an entire cluster of container hosts, along with ensuring that these workloads can communicate with each other and the wider network. It supports multiple container types, with the most well-known being the Docker container.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                Docker containers are an implementation of virtualisation, which allows a 'virtual' computer system to be hosted within another computer system. Containers appear to operate as a separate entity to its host, but still use the host's kernel, bringing efficiency benefits over more mature virtualisation technologies like the virtual machine. In addition, by default, each Docker container is isolated from other containers which share the same host, allowing a single server to host multiple container lab environments.
                            </p> 
                            <p>                                     
                                The final challenge of our application's design was how we would implement user account management for the application. We considered two approaches:

                                <ol>
                                    <li>User accounts managed directly through the application.</li>
                                    <li>User accounts managed through an existing authentication and authorisation system controlled by the School of IT</li>
                                </ol>

                                We decided to take the latter approach, integrating our application into the School of IT's existing Google-based email system, as we felt this would be more convenient for users, while also simplifying management of user permissions.
                            </p>

                                        Kubernetes, Docker containers, and the ASP.NET Core framework were new to the team, and it took time to learn how to use them. This learning was worthwhile, however, as we are confident that we now have valuable experience that we can use in the workplace.
                                    </p>

                                        Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, some software the team had expected to have access to was not available. However, we were able to resolve this by substituting for other software where possible, and using the G Suite tools provided by the School of IT. 
                                    </p>
                                        Much of the difficulty of this process was removed due to the team already using Google Drive as the main project data repository. In addition to this, Google Chat and Meet were used for intra-team communication.
                                    </p>

                                        We chose to use an iterative approach to development, with development split into three iterations. Core features of the application were scheduled for development in the first iteration, with additional functionality being developed in the later iterations. At the end of each iteration, the team had a status meeting with the client, where the team would demonstrate the deliverables for the iteration, and seek feedback.
                                    </p>    
                                         

                                    
                                </figure>

                                        The team used the Kanban approach to workflow management to keep the team's focus on development.
                                        Work items were recorded on kanban cards at the beginning of the iteration. From here, the developers chose the order of work, and focused on completing the work associated with one or two Kanban cards at any one time.
                                    </p>

                                As it stands, the Athena application is feature-complete, and could be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. 
                                
                                Currently, all users of the Athena web applications can:
                                
                                <ul>

                            On top of this to this basic functionality, School of IT staff can also:

                                We were able to finish development of all planned application features, and have completed some testing of the system in operation. Due to complications resuting from the COVID-19 lockdown, we were not able to deploy the system to School of IT hardware for testing at a larger scale. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In addition to the aforementioned testing, there are several avenues for expansion:

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Investigate the feasibility of hosting virtual machines inside Docker containers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Extend the application's user interface so that users can see all their running/current lab environments in one place.
                                    </li>
