			<h2>The Problem & The Drive</h2>
			<h6>The background and context which drove the team, and this project.</h6>
			
				
					<p>
					     The field of CyberSecurity in today's technological and interconnected world, has seen a great spike in popularity, relevance and demand. Yet there are many who lack a true insight into what this field has to offer. They then hesitant to join in the study and practices of this field, due to the lack of accurate knowledge. Many still assume it all just boils down to <i>"The Matrix"</i> style of hacking.  <br><br>

      The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive and informative Cybersecurity learning experience in the form of fun, exciting, and even challenging, Capture the flag (CTF) challenges. Capture the flag is an IT game that requires competitors to utilize different tools, and techniques to recover hidden “flags”, the players would then enter their found flags into the CTFd.io website (Or whichever CTF service is being used) to confirm that they have the correct flag and score points. <br><br>
	  
	  The desired outcome of this project is for participants to gain knowledge, potential understanding, and a clearer insight into what the vast CyberSecurity field has to offer, by performing and completing the tasks, and ultimately, cultivate an interest in the expanding field of CyberSecurity.

									<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<h6>Our proposed solution to the aforementioned problem</h6>
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-8 featured-work">
					<div class="featured-box-col2 wow fadeInRight delay-02s">

					<p align="justify">As stated above, the team would design and develop a series of CTF challenges that are educational, interactive, and fun. They will be hosted on the ctfd.io website, run for varying amounts of time, and are based on the core disciplines of cybersecurity. Which include digital forensics, web-based, cryptography, social engineering, network-based, and many more. The challenge types can range from things such as jeopardy style or attack and defense. The Client wishes to employ some of these challenges during WelTec open days, in an attempt to increase awareness, and giving a taster of what the cybersecurity field has to offer. 
<br><br>

					Aside from the varying topics being covered, these modules, and their respective questions, will have varying diffculties, so as to create a healthy mix of learning and challenge, and cater to varying degrees of knowledge. Documentation will also accompany the modules. They will range from the narratives, which provide a story context for each of the modules and the flags participants are hunting for, and the instructional documents which have been written to allow for anyone to easily follow along, or if teachers wish to use the modules strictly for learning purposes and less of a challenge. Hints are also provided if they are needed, but many come at the cost of points.</p>

This is so the institute may use the product at their open days to encourage high-school level students (and anyone with no prior experience of the cybersecurity field) to join WelTec, particularly the cybersecurity field. As a senior lecturer Paul reports to both the Head of School and the Program Manager.

			<h2>The Project Team</h2>
			<h6>Take a closer look into the profiles of the Sentinel Security team members.</h6>
			
				<p class="wow fadeInDown delay-09s">This Capture the Flag Project consisted of three members. These members are all working towards a Bachelor of IT, majoring in Information Security and Assurance (CyberSecurity). Harsiddha Talwar, Ryan Jacobson, and Jonathan Kothapally have all brought different skills for the task of completing this project.<br><br>

<b>Harsiddha Talwar</b> is a senior student of the Bachelor of Information Technology, and majoring in Cybersecurity. - <i>"Throughout my time at Weltec I have learnt many new skills, and refined some old ones. A core vision that my team and I have shared for this project, is to make something that gives a true insight into what the cybersecurity field truly has to offer, so that others may gain the same enjoyment and knowledge that I have gained."</i><br><br>
 
<b>Ryan Jacobson</b> is a senior student of the Bachelor of Information Technology, and majoring in Cybersecurity. - <i>"Weltec has shown me an array of tools and techniques, across several different IT disciplines, many of which I have used in this project. Aside from the knowledge I have accumulated, Weltec has also connected me to people who I’ve come to form long-term relationships with."</i><br><br>

<b>Jonathan Kothapally</b> is a senior student of the Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Cyber security. - <i>"From start to finish, I've really learnt a lot at Weltec. I was mainly responsible for the technical aspects of the project such as, Designing and Developing the modules.  Throughout the project I acquired a lot of different skills and mainly learned how to work effectively in a diverse, team based environment."</i><br><br>

The team's Advisor for this project was <b>Dr. Dax Roberts</b>. Who is also a senior lecturer at Weltec's School of Infomration Technology.

			<h2>The Future</h2>
			<h6>What's Next?</h6>
				<p class="wow fadeInDown delay-09s">The beauty of this project also lies in its ability to be taken to even greater heights constantly. We feel this project helps to establish a foundation of sorts and can be expanded upon exponentionally. More modules, new tools and techniques can be used, and more topics can be covered, each with their own difficulty. we feel that a project of this nature doesn't just stop after development, for there is always room to add and improve. Who knows? It might even be you who builds upon this.</p>
